I studied software engineering at the University of Victoria. I am currently a lead software engineer at [Riipen](https://riipen.io/landing) working on platform development. Riipen is an EdTech startup. We are looking to solve the experience gap and underemployment. We do this by pairing up students with industry partners to provide valuable real-world experience.

I love programming languages and learning how they work. This blog is focuses on computer science and programming related topics. Follow me through the ups and downs of problems/challenges I face through my employment and personal projects!
