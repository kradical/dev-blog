I am currently in my final semester of software engineering at the University of Victoria. I love programming languages and learning how they work. This blog is mainly focussed on computer science and programming related topics. I will often document problems and challenges I am having or interesting things I learn.

I am also working part time doing iOS and service developement for Level48, a small Victoria based tech start up.
