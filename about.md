I am a 4th year engineering student at the University of Victoria. Currently grinding it out to graduation while working part time doing iOS developement. This blog is a collection of posts on assorted topics. I plan to post about things I am learning to solidify ideas and have a written reference of what I have been through. If any posts are useful to others that is a double bonus.
